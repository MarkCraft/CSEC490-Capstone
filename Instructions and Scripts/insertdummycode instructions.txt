Using gtirb-rewriting: https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb-rewriting

Suggestions:
- Look at the "Getting Started" guide: https://github.com/GrammaTech/gtirb-rewriting/blob/main/doc/Getting-Started.md
- Watch the gtirb-rewriting presentation: https://download.grammatech.com/research/gtirb-rewriting.mp4

Script modifications:
- A "patch" is how you can insert into the GTIRB file
- insertdummcode.py does the following:
  * Obtains a list of blocks from the last function in the .text section
  * Prints the first block in that list, and then inserts "dummy_patch" into the function
- You can write your own patches in the same format, but replace the dummy instructions with the lines of code you wish to insert

Usage:
- Lift to GTIRB using Ddisasm
- Run the script with:
  * "python .\insertdummcode.py 'inputfile.gtirb' 'outputfile.gtirb'"
- Either save the modified GTIRB file to a .txt file for viewing, or recompile to .exe:
  * "gtirb-pprinter 'outputfile.gtirb' >> 'outputtext.txt'"
  * "gtirb-pprinter 'outputfile.gtirb' --binary 'outputexe.exe
